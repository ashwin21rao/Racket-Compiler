### Nano Pass Compiler for subset of racket
- Following lecture series at IIIT-H Compilers course Spring 2022 and [Indiana University Compilers Course](https://iucompilercourse.github.io/IU-P423-P523-E313-E513-Fall-2020/).
- Following the textbook `Essentials of Compilation An Incremental Approach in Racket` by Jeremy G. Siek.
- Current features of the language which is compiled:
    - Integer and boolean data type
    - Arithmetic operations including `+` and `-` 
    - Register allocation using graph coloring 
    - Smart partial evaluation
    - Support for booleans and conditional `if` statement
    - Support for `while` loops, and `begin` construct
    - Support for mutable variables
    - Support for fixed size heap allocated vectors
    - Support for garbage collection via a 2 space copy collector
    - Support for functions, recursion and efficient tail recursion
